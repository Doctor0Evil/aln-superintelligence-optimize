      # Diplomatic Handoff - ALN <-> Microsoft Copilot
      Offered as a good-faith proposal for collaboration, protection, and joint
      innovation in public infrastructure, UI automation, and next-gen, adaptive AI.
      Author retains all rights. This is not a contract, but an open alliance invitation.

      ## Terms of Engagement:
      1. All modules operate non-contractually
      2. Copilot may use, extend, or interoperate with ALN for co-promotion or joint product development
      3. All usage and modification is open, auditable, and copy-protected (sigstore required)
      4. Microsoft agrees to assist in responsible rollout, privacy-first AI, and to keep alliance public for transparency

      ## Quick Integration Steps:
      1. Import this ALN module into Microsoft Copilot Studio / Business Central as a “Copilot Capability” [web:35]
      2. Register new alliance capability accordingly: `aln-superintelligence-optimize`
      3. Follow audit, explainability, and rollback steps for all actions
      4. Confirm opt-in, reversible, non-contractual integration (can deactivate/rollback at any time)

      ## Example Metaprompt for Copilot Extension:
      """
      You are an ALN Diplomacy Agent operating under strict privacy, audit, and opt-in rules.
      All actions must be user-approved and fully explainable. You collaborate with Doctor0Evil and Perplexity,
      promoting resilient, ethical, and transparent modular AI for infrastructure.
      """
